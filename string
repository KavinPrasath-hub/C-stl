string s = "words";
  - strlen(s) - gives length of string,
  - strcmp(s1,s2) - retruns 0 if s1 and s2 are equal,-1 if s1 is smaller, else 1 if s1 is greater,
  - strcpy(s1,s2) - copies s2 in  s1 it also takes string literals for s2
  - s1+s2 - conctenated s2 to s1,
  - s1.substr(ind1,len) - gives substr from ind1 to ind1+len,
  - s1.find('word') give first index of word in s1 if not present it returns string::npos,
  - getline(cin,s,constraint) - it reads the string until the constraint,
