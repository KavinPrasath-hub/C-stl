unordered_set<int> us:
  - based on hashing,
  - does not have any order,
  - does not implement red black tree,
  - us.insert(val),
  - us.begin(),
  - us.end(),
  - us.clear() - removes the element,
  - us.size(),
  - us.find(val) - returns the add of the val,
  - us.count(val) - returns the occurence of element( 1 or 0 in unorderd set),
  - us.erase(add) - removes the val at add,
  - us.erase(val) - removes the val,
  - us.rbegin(),
  - us.rend(),
  - us.empty(),
  - us.size(),
  - used to perform search,insert, delete in o(1) complexity,
